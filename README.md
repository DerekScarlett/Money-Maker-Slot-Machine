How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

What I did for this project and allow the user to to either decided to bet $1 or $5 by using a click event that appends thier new total to the DOM. This amount is subtracted from thier total. Then when you press start another click event happens that starts the game. one of the 3 images on screen is randomly given a source from an array of images. if those images equal each other then you total increases but if they dont then you total decreases and that new total is appendd to the DOM.

Optimizations
If I have time to go back then I would try to display a message after you lose all you money and add more slot options.

Lessons Learned:
I learned to utilize arrays to create different events.
